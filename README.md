- 👋 Hi, I’m john i have an asus gameing laptop, . my laptop is being pulled to bits via linux scripts
- by unknown persons, at first i thought they were after me , but all the scripts are tailor made for ASUS, I  KNOW YOUR COMMUNITYS SOFTWARE, i have down loaded some freeware and it has slowedd them down, I have noton 360 on windows 11
- i have PrivaZer, thats been hacked and all my systetem restore points for the last  8 weeks have gone, or it could be im in another profile.

- But I do have something to trade its a bit odd, i know they want it back , it a self relicating file

Im trying tosee what  the file can do and this and there trying to crash my machine, so turn to you!! your my only hope.

I nave a file created in 2080 why would u teleport into the future to create an alternate reality to get afile to hack me and donald trump to rise to power !!!
